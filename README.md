# Pokemon_Image_Classifier_Pokedex_with_Alexnet

This is an initiative Project for Neural network with Concept of Making a System like Pokedex which has been trained with the pretrained model of Alexnet. Our goal is to make a very accurate system such as pokedex which will be able to detect the Accurate Pokemon with their Name Lable and would provide the related information to the user. To get at this point where wer now, we have used this below Pokemon Datasets from Kaggle which has more over 800+ Pokemon images to signify its performance and have been training the model again and again for better performance

You can find the pretrained model Down below:
you will find it as a name of "model_checkpoint.pth"
